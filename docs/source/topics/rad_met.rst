Overview of radionuclide metrology
==================================

Radionuclide metrology
----------------------

**Radionuclide metrology** is the science of measuring radioactivity with high precision and accuracy.
Its primary goal is to ensure the reliability and consistency of radioactivity measurements across the world
and across various applications, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, and nuclear energy production.

National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) around the world work coordinately to this goal.
Radionuclide metrology laboratories try to met this goal through:

- **Primary standardisation techniques**:
  Using methods like liquid scintillation counting and coincidence techniques,
  they realise the SI-derived unit for activity of a radionuclide, which is the becquerel (Bq),
  and provide the most accurate measurements of activity.

- **International comparisons**:
  Through key comparisons of their standards, they demonstrate international equivalence of the activity
  measurements worldwide.

- **Secondary standardisation techniques**:
  They provide the tools needed to convert a count rate in a detector into an activity measurement traceable to the
  International System of Units (SI).
  They provide certified radioactive sources for calibration, accurate half-life values, emission
  probabilities of various types of radiation (x rays, gamma rays, alpha particles, conversion electrons, Auger
  electrons), and evaluated decay schemes of the most important radionuclides.

Radionuclide standardization
----------------------------

In the context of radionuclide metrology, radionuclide standardization refers to the process of
establishing accurate and reliable measurements of the activity (radioactive decay rate) of radionuclides.
This is crucial for ensuring consistency and accuracy in various applications,
such as medical diagnostics, treatment, environmental monitoring, and nuclear power.

The key steps involved are:

- **Primary Standardization**:
  This is the direct measurement of the number of nuclear transformations per unit time without relying on other calibrations or standards.
  It forms the basis for physical measurement standards of activity.
- **Measurement Techniques**:
  Various techniques are used for primary standardization, including:
  Liquid scintillation counting (LSC), coincidence counting, triple to double coincidence ratio (TDCR) and
  CIEMAT-NIST efficiency tracing
- **Traceability**:
  Measurements are traceable to international standards, such as those maintained by the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs)
  Examples of NMIs are NIST (United States), NPL (United Kingdom), PTB (Germany), LNHB (France) and LMRI (Spain).
  This traceability ensures that results are comparable across different laboratories and applications.
- **Detector Modeling**:
  Detailed modeling of detectors using Monte Carlo radiation transport and interaction methods is important for
  uncertainty analysis and understanding the effects of impurities.

The standardization of a radionuclide involves determining several key quantities that characterize its radioactive properties.
These quantities ensure accurate and reliable measurements for various applications. Here are the main quantities:

- **Activity** (A): This is the rate at which a radionuclide decays, measured in becquerels (Bq), where 1 Bq equals one decay per second.
  It is a fundamental quantity in radionuclide standardization.
- **Half-life** (:math:`t_{1/2}`): The time required for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay.
  This is crucial for understanding the longevity and decay behavior of the radionuclide.
- **Decay modes**: The types of radiation emitted during decay, such as alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays.
  Each decay mode has specific energy levels associated with it.
- **Energy of emissions**: The energy levels of the emitted particles or photons, typically measured in electron volts (eV).
  This helps in identifying the radionuclide and understanding its interaction with matter.
- **Specific activity**: The activity per unit mass of the radionuclide, often expressed in Bq/g.
  This is important for applications where the concentration of the radionuclide is critical.
- **Gamma-ray emission probabilities**: The likelihood of gamma-ray emissions per decay,
  which is essential for applications involving gamma-ray spectroscopy and imaging.
- **Branching ratios**: The probabilities of different decay paths that a radionuclide can take.
  This helps in understanding the complete decay scheme of the radionuclide.

Liquid scintillation counting (LSC)
-----------------------------------

**Liquid scintillation counting (LSC)** is a measuring technique for the determination of low energetic β-emitters.
It is capable to detect all processes emitting light photons, both, directly and indirectly.
Therefore, it is also applicable for high energetic β-emitters, electron capture nuclides and α-emitters.

This technique involves mixing a radioactive sample with a scintillation cocktail,
which emits light when it interacts with radiation.
The emitted light is then measured to determine the activity of the radionuclide, using photomultiplier tubes.
This method provides very high efficiency due to the intimate contact between sample and scintillator.
It also provides a high degree of accuracy and is suitable for a wide range of radionuclides

In radionuclide metrology, LSC has been successfully employed for the standardization of many radionuclides for decades.
There are two methods to do this: the CIEMAT/NIST efficiency tracing and the triple-to-double coincidence ratio (TDCR).
Both methods are accepted by Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionization Radiation (CCIR) in
Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) for the international reference system (SIR) for pure β-emitters.

Triple-to-double coincidence ratio (TDCR)
-----------------------------------------

The **triple-to-double coincidence ratio (TDCR)** method is a fundamental method in liquid scintillation counting.
It is an absolute method for the determination of the activity of β- and EC-decaying radionuclides
in liquid scintillator medium.

It is a universal method applicable for both chemical and color quenching, for aqueous and organic samples and
for different cocktails and range of isotopes.
Unlike other methods, this method does not need external or internal standard sources.

The method itself is based on a physical and statistical model of the distribution of scintillation photons and
their detection probability in a three-photomultiplier (PMT) counter.
It combines experimental data with theoretical calculations of the detector efficiency.
The knowledge of the radionuclide decay scheme data is precondition.
