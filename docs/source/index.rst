MetPyRad documentation
======================

Welcome to **MetPyRad**â€™s documentation.
**MetPyRad** is a Python package that provides a collection of tools for radionuclide metrology.
It is an open source, GPLv3-licensed library for the Python programming language.
It is compatible with Python 3.

**MetPyRad** provides tools for processing measurements for a given radionuclide using a **Hidex TDCR** (Triple to Double Coincidence Ratio) system.
It is designed to facilitate the handling, analysis, and summarization of measurement data.

The documentation for the **MetPyRad** package is structured into four main sections:
tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, and explanations.
Here's a summary of each section:

1. **Tutorials**: Oriented towards learning, these tutorials guide beginners through the initial setup and basic usage of the package.
2. **How-to guides**: Goal-oriented guides that provide step-by-step instructions to solve specific problems.
3. **Technical reference**: Information-oriented descriptions of the package's machinery, including attributes and methods.
